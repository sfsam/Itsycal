I've learned a lot by looking at other people's code so
maybe someone can learn something from looking at mine.

Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac's menu bar.

If you want, it will display your calendar events as a
companion to the Mac Calendar app. You can also create
and delete (but not edit) events.

## For me
I'm just change menu icon display like calendar icon, date text, day of week and time. It's seens like OS X base information.
